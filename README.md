## Welcome to Quantized!  
  
This mod allows you to deconstruct any item into its quantum components and use that to construct any item you desire! But there's a catch: the more complex or "expensive" an item is, the more time and energy it takes to construct or analyze.

#### How to get going:
1.  Craft some steel:
	-  Steel is the building block of quantized. It's acquired by re-smelting iron in a blast furnace
	- It's used in almost all crafting recipes of quantized.

2. Create new tools:
	*   To craft essential crafting components like steel plates or copper wire, you'll need a mallet and some wire cutters
	* With them, you'll craft some inductors, electromagnets, and more!

3. Now give up some junk:
	- The first machine you'll need to craft is the quantum destabiizer
	- Deconstruct some not-needed stuff into quantum flux
	- Then craft a quantum collapser and pipe some quantum flux into it to produce stable q-bits
	- Then craft them into q-bytes and finally a quantum drive

4. Research time:
	- Now craft a quantum analyzer and put your brand-new quantum drive into it.
	- Then feed it some juice to get the item saved into the drive.

5. Assemble your first items:
	- Craft the quantum fabricator, then put the drive with the analyzed item in it
	- Feed it some power, and then, Bam, the items you wanted!

### Usage in modpacks:
- You're free to use this mod in modpacks
- There is a special folder in the config folder of quantized, where you can put your custom quantum item values, either rewrite the original ones or add new ones for other mods.
